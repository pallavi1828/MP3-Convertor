# MP3-Convertor
This project is a front-end UI design for a Spotify to MP3 Converter built using only HTML and CSS. While it doesnâ€™t include backend functionality to actually download or convert Spotify music (due to platform restrictions and legality), it visually demonstrates how such a converter interface could look.
